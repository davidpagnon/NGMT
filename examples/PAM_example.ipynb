                "The example illustrates how the physical activity monitoring (PAM) algorithm is used to determine the intensity level of sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activities using body acceleration recorded with a triaxial accelerometer worn on the wrist. The physical activity monitoring algorithm is implemented in the main module `NGMT\\ngmt\\modules\\PAM.py`.\n",
                "\n",
                "The algorithm determines the intensity level of the physical activities based on the following steps. It starts by loading the input_data, which includes data with a time index along with accelerometer data (N, 3) for x, y, and z axes. The other input of the algorithm is sampling_frequency, which is in Hz, and the default value is 100. Another input of the algorithm is thresholds, which should be provided as a dictionary containing threshold values for physical activity detection. Epoch length, which is defined in seconds, is the next input of the algorithm, as shown with epoch_duration. The default value is 5 seconds. The last input of the algorithm is plot_results, which, if set to True, generates a plot showing the average Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) per hour for each date. The default is True.\n",
                "\n",
                "The following steps are taken to preprocess the input signal. First, the sample-level Euclidean norm (EN) of the acceleration signal across the x, y, and z axes is calculated. Next, a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 20Hz is applied to remove noise. This filter is applied to the vector magnitude scores, rather than the individual axes. To separate out the activity-related component of the acceleration signal, the ENMO index is calculated. The Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) is a summary metric for acceleration data and represents the vector magnitude of 3 axial measures minus the contribution of gravity (1 g). Then, negative values of the ENMO are truncated to zero. Finally, the calculated indices are multiplied by 1000 to convert the units of the acceleration from g to milli-g.\n",
                "\n",
                "The algorithm continues by classifying the intensity of the physical activities based on the calculated ENMO values. Using the activity_classification function, the ENMO time-series data is then expressed in 5-second epochs. Epochs with a length of 5 seconds are used for summarizing the data, as this epoch length has been suggested to be able to capture shorter bouts of activities. The greater the intensity of movement and duration of activity in the summed 5-second epochs are, the greater the ENMO value is. Then, the intensity of activities as the time distribution of ENMO using 5-second epochs is used to classify activities based on different thresholds. In the analysis of intensity distribution, the following thresholds are used for categorization: sedentary activity < 45 milli-g, light activity 45–100 milli-g, moderate activity 100–400 milli-g, vigorous activity > 400 milli-g.\n",
