    "# Pam Physical Activity Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "This example serves as a reference on how to use the physical activity monitoring algorithm. This example can be cited by referencing the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example illustrates how the physical activity monitoring algorithm determines the intensity level of sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activities using body acceleration recorded with a triaxial accelerometer worn on the wrist. The physical activity monitoring algorithm is implemented in the main module [`ngmt.modules.pam._pam`](https://github.com/neurogeriatricskiel/NGMT/tree/main/ngmt/modules/pam/_pam.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm determines the intensity level of physical activities based on the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data:** Start by loading the data, including a time index along with accelerometer data (N, 3) for x, y, and z axes. The other inputs are the sampling frequency of the data (sampling_freq_Hz), defaulting to 100 Hz, and thresholds (thresholds_mg), provided as a dictionary containing threshold values for physical activity detection in mg unit. Another input is the epoch duration (epoch_duration_sec) in seconds, defaulting to 5 seconds. The last input, plot_results, when set to True, generates a plot showing the average Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) per hour for each date, with a default of True.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing:** The input signal is preprocessed by calculating the sample-level Euclidean norm (EN) of the acceleration signal across the x, y, and z axes. A fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 20Hz is then applied to remove noise. This filter is applied to the vector magnitude scores. The ENMO index is calculated to separate the activity-related component of the acceleration signal. Negative ENMO values are truncated to zero. Finally, the indices are multiplied by 1000 to convert units from g to mg.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classification:** The algorithm classifies the intensity of physical activities based on the calculated ENMO values. The activity_classification function expresses the ENMO time-series data in 5-second epochs for summarizing the data. Thresholds for categorization are as follows: sedentary activity < 45 mg, light activity 45–100 mg, moderate activity 100–400 mg, vigorous activity > 400 mg.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results:** The algorithm classifies different levels of activities along with the time spent on each activity level for each day. If `plot_results` is set to True, the function generates a plot showing the averaged ENMO values for each day.\n",
