# Background

The definition of our data classes is derived from the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standards](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/motion.html). The BIDS extension for motion analysis requires that motion data from each tracking system is stored in a single `*_motion.tsv` file. A **tracking system** is defined as *a group of motion channels that share hardware properties (the recording device) and software properties (the recording duration and number of samples)*. All relevant metadata about any tracking system is stored in an accompanying sidecar `*_tracksys-<label>_motion.json` file. Data from different tracking systems are stored in different `*_tracksys-<label>_motion.tsv` files, each of which is accompanied by `*_tracksys-<label>_motion.json` and `*_tracksys-<label>_channels.tsv` files.
