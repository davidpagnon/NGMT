This part of the project documentation focuses on
the avaliable **modules**.


The Gait Sequence Diagram Analysis (GSDB) module is a module that can be used to extract gait events from a gait sequence diagram.

The Physical Activity Monitoring (PHAM) module is a module that can be used to determine the intensity level of sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activities using body acceleration recorded with a triaxial accelerometer worn on the wrist.
